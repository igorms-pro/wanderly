## 🎯 Issue #1: Database Schema & Backend Setup

**Status:** 🟢 **COMPLETED**  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Phase:** Foundation  
**Dependencies:** Issue #0

### Description

Complete database schema, RLS policies, migrations, and all Supabase infrastructure.

### Tasks

#### Database Tables

- [x] 🟢 **Verify all tables exist and are correct**:
  - [x] `users` (profiles)
  - [x] `trips` (with `constraints` JSONB for budget/children/preferences/pace/must-dos/no-gos)
  - [x] `trip_members` (with roles: owner, editor, viewer, moderator)
  - [x] `activities` (with source: human/ai, status, cost, location)
  - [x] `scenarios` (implemented as `itineraries` table)
  - [x] `scenario_activities` (implemented via `itinerary_days` + link to `activities`)
  - [x] `votes` (for activities)
  - [x] `messages` (chat)
  - [ ] `expenses` (Phase 2, can wait)

#### RLS Policies

- [x] 🟢 **Review and update ALL RLS policies**:
  - [x] Users can only see trips they're members of
  - [x] Trip members policies (CRUD based on role owner/editor/viewer/moderator)
  - [x] Activities policies (admins = owner/editor/moderator can create/update/delete)
  - [x] Scenarios policies (itineraries + itinerary_days follow same writer rules)
  - [x] Votes policies (any member can vote; users can update their own votes)
  - [x] Messages policies (trip members only)
  - [ ] Expenses policies (Phase 2)

#### Migrations

- [x] 🟢 **Verify all migrations are applied**:
  - [x] 🟢 001_initial_schema.sql

  - [x] 🟢 003_enable_realtime.sql
  - [x] 🟢 004_preferences_audit_logs.sql
  - [x] 🟢 005_rls_preferences_audit.sql
  - [x] 🟢 006_realtime_preferences.sql (kept commented/optional)
  - [x] 🟢 007_trip_constraints.sql

#### Real-time Setup

- [x] 🟢 Supabase Realtime enabled (trips, activities, votes, messages; preferences optional)
- [ ] 🔴 Verify realtime works for all tables (manual runtime check later)
- [ ] 🔴 Test real-time subscriptions (manual runtime check later)

#### TypeScript Types

- [x] 🟢 **Regenerate types from database (initial version)**:
  - [x] `src/lib/types/database.types.ts` reflects all current tables and `trips.constraints`
  - [ ] Optionally re-run `supabase gen types typescript` later to sync with remote DB

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All tables exist with correct schema (MVP + Phase 2 placeholders)
- [x] All RLS policies are configured according to roles and trip membership
- [ ] Real-time works for all tables (to be verified via runtime tests)
- [x] TypeScript types are up-to-date for current schema

**Next Review:** Weekly

**CRITICAL PATH**:

1. Complete Issue #1 (Database) ✅
2. Complete Issue #2 (i18n) ✅
3. Complete Issue #4 (Design System) ✅
4. Then work on screens sequentially (#5 → #6 → #7 → #8 → #9 → #10 → etc.)

**BLOCKER**: Issue #10 (Voting) CANNOT start until Issue #9 (Activities) is complete.
